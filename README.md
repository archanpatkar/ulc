<h3>Untyped Lambda Calculus</h3>
</div>

ULC is a small functional programming language based on [Lambda Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus)(also known as untyped lambda calculus) with an interpreter (also compiles(pre-alpha) to SKI combinators). The syntax and semantics are similar to [styla](https://github.com/archanpatkar/styla) but ULC adds `let` bindings, `pairs` and removes typing.
